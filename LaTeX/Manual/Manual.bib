abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Toxins A and B (TcdA and TcdB) are Clostridium difficile's principal virulence factors, yet the pathways by which they lead to inflammation and severe diarrhea remain unclear. Also, the relative role of either toxin during infection and the differences in their effects across cell lines is still poorly understood. To better understand their effects in a susceptible cell line, we analyzed the transciptome-wide gene expression response of human ileocecal epithelial cells (HCT-8) after 2, 6, and 24 hours of toxin exposure. RESULTS: We show that toxins elicit very similar changes in the gene expression of HCT-8 cells, with the TcdB response occurring sooner. The high similarity suggests differences between toxins are due to events beyond transcription of a single cell-type and that their relative potencies during infection may depend on differential effects across cell types within the intestine. We next performed an enrichment analysis to determine biological functions associated with changes in transcription. Differentially expressed genes were associated with response to external stimuli and apoptotic mechanisms and, at 24 hours, were predominately associated with cell-cycle control and DNA replication. To validate our systems approach, we subsequently verified a novel G1/S and known G2/M cell-cycle block and increased apoptosis as predicted from our enrichment analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a successful example of a workflow deriving novel biological insight from transcriptome-wide gene expression. Importantly, we do not find any significant difference between TcdA and TcdB besides potency or kinetics. The role of each toxin in the inhibition of cell growth and proliferation, an important function of cells in the intestinal epithelium, is characterized.},

abstract = {Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation category amongst the differential expression results from a microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},

Understanding these systems needs integrated bioinformatic analysis. Public databases such as Ensembl provide relationships and mappings between the relevant sets of probe and target molecules. However, the relationships can be biologically complex and the content of the databases is dynamic. We demonstrate how to use the computational environment R to integrate and jointly analyze experimental datasets, employing BioMart web services to provide the molecule mappings. We also discuss typical problems that are encountered in making gene-to-transcript-to-protein mappings.

abstract = {Clostridium difficile is the major cause of intestinal infections in hospitals. The major virulence factors are toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), which belong to the group of clostridial glucosylating toxins (CGT) that inactivate small GTPases. After a 24 h incubation period with TcdA or a glucosyltransferase-deficient mutant TcdA (gdTcdA), quantitative changes in the proteome of colonic cells (Caco-2) were analyzed using high-resolution LC-MS/MS and the SILAC technique. The changes in abundance of more than 5100 proteins were quantified. Nearly 800 toxin-responsive proteins were identified that were involved in cell cycle, cell structure, and adhesion as well as metabolic processes. Several proteins localized to mitochondria or involved in lipid metabolism were consistently of higher abundance after TcdA treatment. All changes of protein abundance depended on the glucosyltransferase activity of TcdA. Glucosylation of the known targets of TcdA such as RhoA, RhoC, RhoG was detected by LC-MS/MS. In addition, an almost complete glucosylation of Rap1(A/B), Rap2(A/B/C) and a partial glucosylation of Ral(A/B) and (H/K/N)Ras were detected. The glucosylation pattern of TcdA was compared to that of other CGT like TcdB, the variant TcdB from C. difficile strain VPI 1470 (TcdBF), and lethal toxin from C. sordellii (TcsL).},

abstract = {Microarray experiments are currently widely applied in many areas of biomedical research. The Affymetrix GeneChip system is a commercial high-density oligonucleotide microarray platform which measures gene expression using hundreds of thousands of 25-mer oligonucleotide probes. This dissertation addresses how probe intensity data from GeneChips are processed to produce gene expression values and shows how better pre-processing leads to gene expression measures, that after further analysis, yield biologically meaningful conclusions. An ideal expression measure is one which is both precise and accurate. A three-stage procedure for producing an expression measure is proposed. For each of the three stages, background correction, normalization and summarization, numerous methods are developed and assessed using spike-in datasets. Bias and variance criteria are used to compare the different methods of producing expression values. The methods are also judged by how well they correctly identify the differential genes. The background method has a significant effect on the bias, which is reduced, and the variability, which is usually increased. Non-linear normalization methods are found to reduce the non-biological variability between multiple arrays without introducing any significant bias. Robust multi-chip linear models are found to fit the data well and provide the recommended summarization method. The summarization methodology is extended to produce test statistics for determining differential genes. These test statistics perform favorably at correctly detecting differential genes when compared with alternative methods based on expression values. Finally, using case study data, no statistical benefit is found for using arrays hybridized with mRNA from a pool rather than from a single biological source. Professor},
