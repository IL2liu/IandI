#### This script is NOT intended to reproduce a particular analysis
#### Rather, it is the "sandbox" which was used to manually search
#### genes within gene sets. One by one, genes within
#### relevant gene sets were studied by using wikipedia, NCBI, and genecards.org
#### Based on these investigations, genes were further categorized
#### as is shown in Figure 3.
#### In the end, this script finishes with two variables: gtpasegenes and
#### metgenes. These varaibles are used in the Figure3.R script
